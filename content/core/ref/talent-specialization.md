## Description

Select a skill your actor has that was not selected by the 
[Assurance]({{< ref "/core/ref/assurance-specialization.md" >}}) 
specialization. Increase its die by one 
[increment]({{< ref "/core/chapters/introduction.md#die-increments" >}}).

If this is not the first time you have taken this specialization, it costs one
*sp* extra for each past purchase. For example, if you have selected this
specialization two times prior, the next purchase of this specialization will cost three *sp*.
