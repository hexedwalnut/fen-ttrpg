## Description

Pick an archetype X. You have learned how to best wield a weapon
when it is soon to break. When a weapon of the X archetype is dealt enough 
damage to be sundered, you may use your reaction to cause a Vigor/Fight contest
between you and the damage dealer. If you win the contest, the weapon is not
sundered, instead is reduced to one defense.
