  As part of taking the [Sweep]({{< relref "/armory/ref/sweep-action.md" >}}) major
  action, you force a fight/dodge contest against each target. Any target that 
  loses the contest gains the [prone]({{< relref "/core/ref/prone-condition.md" >}})
  condition. The effect of the prone condition is applied after the sweep damage
  is dealt.
