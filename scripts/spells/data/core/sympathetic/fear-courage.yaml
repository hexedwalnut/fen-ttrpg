  ### Fear

  A target you can see within [long]({{< ref "/core/ref/long.md" >}}) range must succeed a will/magic contest or gain [fear]({{< ref "/core/ref/fear-condition.md" >}})(1).

  #### Sink

  You can spend additional *mp* to cast this spell in the following ways:

  - *Additional target*: you can spend an additional 2 *mp* to select an additional target with this spell
  - *More fear*: you can spend an additional 5 *mp* to increase the number of the fear condition by 1. (i.e., instead of gaining fear(1) they would gain fear(2) if you spend an additional 5 *mp* in this way)
  
  ### Courage
  
  A target you can see within [close]({{< ref "/core/ref/close.md" >}}) range becomes more courageous than normal. The target gains 10 temporary hp. While they have temporary hp, the target is immune to the [fear]({{< ref "/core/ref/fear-condition.md" >}})

  When cast on a target that is already under the effects of the fear condition, the fear condition is removed but the target does not gain the temporary hp.

  #### Sink

  For every 3 mp you spend in addition to the original amount, increase the temporary hp gained by 5.
