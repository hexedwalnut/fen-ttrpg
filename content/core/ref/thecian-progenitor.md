The Thecian progenitor consists of Humans, Dwarfs, and Halflings. Thecians are the divinely created mammalian progenitor, originally created from the bones of dead Alfinims by the Thecian gods the Mother and the Father. They have since split into several races and dominated a large part of Fen.

## Creating a Thecian

When you select this progenitor, you gain 10 *sp*. Thecians span a wide range of looks, heights, and builds. Write a few words on your character sheet to describe your character, if you want you can specify which of the major groups in the Thecians you resemble most: human, dwarf, or halfling. Then select any number of progenitor specializations you think fit your character using the 10 *sp*.
