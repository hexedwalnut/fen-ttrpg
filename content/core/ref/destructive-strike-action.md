*1 major action*

You make one melee attack. If your attack overcomes *dodge* and *defenses* you deal 2 damage to defenses instead of 1. If a feature of the defenses requires a specific condition to be met before taking damage (i.e., more than double excess damage), you must also meet this requirement to deal additional damage.
