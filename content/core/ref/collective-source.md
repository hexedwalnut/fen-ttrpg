*Also known as: Arcane, Wizardly, or Knowledge source.*

It has to be here somewhere. You have spent many a long night, focused, and sleepless hoping beyond home to find something real. It has been three years of sucking up to the guards that has lead to this moment. They collected all the contraband books and stored them here, in the jail house. It was three years of begging, helping, and bribing before they let you inside to "organize." Still, the work will pay off. You find a promising book, old and dusty, bound in nice leather and bolted shut. The rusted latch gives little resistance as the first page sparkles in your eyes. Of all the "spell books" that the guards confiscated in this small town, this one is by far the best. You flip to the first spell, a simple phrase and hand motion. Doable. You practice till dawn, and by the sound of the roasters, you recite the words, flick your fingers, and grasp tight to the spell book. A bolt of red fire scatters against the wall opposite of you. You smile for you have finally found what you have been looking for.

The collective source pulls from the magic power of collective obsession and knowledge. This source pull magic from the feelings, emotions, and cognitive effort of a collective. Not all collectives are connected, and not all collectives are large, but the magic of a group can never be discounted. Often these collectives are academics, scholars, and teachers, focused on the pursuit of knowledge. Conduits of this source might be called wizards, mages, or sorcerers but span the gamut of casting archetypes. 

## Sanctum Arcanus

The collective source is unique in that a conduit needs to develop and maintain a *sanctum* called a Sanctum Arcanus. A *sanctum* is a location that holds the conduits collection of collective knowledge and power. A collective source conduit can pull great strength from their own *sanctum* if they spend the time and resources to develop it well. A collective source conduit without a sanctum will have to rely on publicly available sources of collective knowledge which will greatly limit the number of triggers they can pull from.

A *sanctum* must be constructed either of magic (as per a spell or other effect) or by the hands of a member humanoid creature (i.e, man-made structures). A *sanctum* must consist of a library, a vault, and a praxis arena. The size and shape of these rooms is not specific. The library stores books and manuscripts of the collective knowledge, this can include spell scrolls, spell books, theory and arcane research tombs, etc. The vault stores items of arcane merit or interest, this can include magic items, strange magical creatures, artifacts or art from past civilizations, etc. The praxis arena is an open space fit for arcane experimentation. It holds a sigil of protection, several arcane protected experimentation tables, and research instruments suited for the conduits interests.

Note, a *sanctum* can be integrated into another structure, for example a *sanctum* might be included in a castle, keep, or other fortified structure. Oftentimes they are stand-alone structures, like towers, homes, or cabins. Many times these sanctums have additional rooms (i.e., a bedroom, kitchen, etc.) but they are not required. A *sanctum* is often stolen or claimed by a rival conduit of the collective. Sometimes *sanctums* are destroyed out of spite, or server as the prize for winning a bet. As such, many conduits of the collective keep their *sanctum* secret, hidden, or otherwise obscured from rival's view. A *sanctum* can be integrated into a moving structure (i.e., a ship, or a house with legs). This might limit the scale of the *sanctum* but allows for it to travel.

To construct a *sanctum*, a conduit can follow the same building rules for other structures, or otherwise construct the building using magic. Once the conduit has a structure, they need to fill the *sanctum* with appropriate material as follows:

### Library

There are two considerations for a good library: *breadth* and *depth*. Having a complete library (i.e., maximum result in both breadth and depth) offers a plus five *mp* to both *Study* and *Experiment*.

#### Breadth

There are eight schools of magical theory: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation, these schools have different sub-disciplines and areas of research. In addition there are four magical praxes: Alchemy, Artifice, Ceremony, and Sorcery. To create a library with breadth, books should be included from many different schools and praxes. Consult the following table for more information about a proper breadth in your library:

| School | Praxis | Result                                        |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | 0      | The library is not sufficient for a sanctum   |
| 1      | 1      | No extra benifit, but is enough for a library | 
| 4-5    | 2      | +1 *mp* to *Study*                            |
| 6-7    | 3      | +2 *mp* to *Study*                            |
| 8      | 4      | +3 *mp* to *Study*                            |

*School* represents the number of schools represented in your library's collection, and *Praxis* represents the number of praxes represented in your library's collection.

#### Depth

While breadth is worried about having enough material to study the broad implications of magic, depth is worried about a specific school and praxis. When creating a *sanctum's* library select a specific school and praxis that your conduit specializes in. This selection servers as your area of interest. Consult the following table for more information about proper depth in your library.

| Specialization | Result                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0              | The library is not sufficient for a sanctum  |
| 1-4            | No extra benfit, but is enough for a library |
| 5-8            | +1 *mp* to *Experiment*                      |
| 9-10           | +2 *mp* to *Experiment*                      |
| 10+            | +3 *mp* to *Experiment*                      |

*Specialization* represents the number of books in your selected school and praxis in your library.

### Vault

The vault stores items of arcane merit or interest. This is a lifelong collection and could store both useful and cursed magic items. For each magic item stored in the vault, you gain increases to *Study* and *Experiment* as per the following rules:

- An empty vault is not sufficient for a sanctum
- You gain +1 for every 10 minor magic items (max of 3).
- You gain +1 for every 5 major magic items (max of 3).
- You gain +1 for every great magic item (max of 3).
- You gain +2 for each artifact (max of 6).

Any additional items in the vault do not add any to *Study* or *Experiment*.

### Praxis Arena

The praxis arena consists of several protective runes and places to experiment. A praxis arena costs 1,200gp to initially build. You can upgrade your praxis arena using any of the following:

| Upgrade             | Cost  | Effect |
| ------------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Protective Plating  | 350gp | You add protective platting to your praxis arena, allowing for more intense experimentations. Gain +2 *mp* to *Experiment*. |
| Experiment Tables   | 500gp | You add several experiment tables resistant to magic. Gain +3 *mp* to *Experiment*. |
| Alchemist Tools     | 400gp | You add alchemist tools to your praxis arena. You can craft alchemist items using these tools. Gain +1 *mp* to *Experiment*. |
| Artifice Workshop   | 720gp | You add an artifice workshop to your praxis arena. You can craft artifice items using this workshop. Gain +1 *mp* to *Experiment*. |
| Ceremonial Alcove   | 570gp | You add a ceremonial alcove to your praxis arena. You can craft ceremonial items and cast ceremonys using this alcove. Gain +1 *mp* to *Experiment*. |
| Sorcery Dummy       | 780gp | You add a sorcery dummmy to your praxis arena. You can craft sorcerous items and develop spells using this dummy. Gain +1 *mp* to *Experiement*. |

### Other Sanctum Upgrades

After constructing a *sanctum* you can upgrade your sanctum using any of the following:

| Upgrade             | Cost     | Effect    |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Lead Walls          | 3,200gp  | Actors cannot be targeted by divinition while inside the sanctum. |
| Vault of Holding    | 1,600gp  | Your vault can hold a limitless amount of items. |

## Minor Triggers

- **Study**: You spend four or more hours studying material you have collected. This minor trigger must be completed in your sanctum.
- **Experiment**: You spend eight or more hours conducting an experiment. This minor trigger must be completed in your sanctum.

## Major Triggers

- **Debate**: You spend and hour debating a colleague. Both you and the colleague gain a major trigger. Once you gain *mp* using this trigger, you cannot due this gain for three weeks.
- **Lecture**: You attend a lecture about your specialization. You must accomplish this major trigger at a place of great collective magic.
- **Observation**: You observe an act of magic from a conduit with a different source. This observation must be completed in your sanctum's praxis arena.

## Great Triggers

- **Made Wonders**: There are [Seven Made Wonders]({{< ref "/wiki/seven-made-wonders.md" >}}) of Fen. Resting at one of these made wonders give you a full refill of your *mp*. In addition, if this is the first time you have rested at a specific made wound, you gain temporary *mp* equal to three times your max *mp*. Not all wounder may exist based on the age you are playing in, if not the *GM* will give alternatives for this great trigger. The eight made wonders include:
