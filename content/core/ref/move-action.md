*1 minor action*

Move up to five times the sides of your [*dodge*]({{< ref "/core/ref/dodge-skill.md" >}}) die in a reasonable unit of measure for the combat. For example, in most combats between humanoid creatures, the unit of 5 feet makes sense, but for a combat between factions fighting in open field, 20 yards might be more appropriate. An actor with 1d4 *dodge* can move up to 20 units of measure, thus in a normal combat, 20 feet. You also use this action to remove or add the [*prone*]({{< ref "/core/ref/prone-condition.md" >}}) condition to yourself.
