## Description

**You cannot take this specialization in a non-magical age of Fen.**

After selecting this specialization you cannot gain [King of Iron]({{< ref "/core/ref/king-of-iron-specialization.md" >}}) specialization by any means.

You are a descendant of one of the ancient dwarven Kings of Gold. Not all that
descend from the old Kings of Gold have the gift, but by the gold flecks in your
eyes and the clearness of your ambition, you do. There is no price gold cannot
pay.

You gain [Talent]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization.md" >}}) in 
[articulate]({{< ref "/core/ref/articulate-skill.md" >}}) and gain the
[Conduit]({{< ref "/core/ref/conduit-specialization.md" >}}) specialization
with a modified 
[Sacrificial Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/sacrificial-source.md" >}}). You may 
pick your own spell list and other features. While a 
normal sacrificial source conduit pays *hp* to regain *mp*, you instead must
pay gold (or other currency equivalent). You only have the following trigger:

### The Golden Price 

You can gain X *mp* by destroying X gold piece value of currency, where X is
any positive whole number. The gold piece (or other currency) vanishes as payment
for the spell energy. This can be done in a combat using a major action.

### Chrusification

*Chrusification*: To become gold.

Through the process of casting spells this way your body starts to ossify golden.
Parts of your body become hard and look to be made of gold. This cannot be 
undone by any means. 

You gain the Chrusifiaction tally statistic. This statistic works similarly
to *wp*, You start with a maximum of 20 Chrusification points and no tallies.
After each time you cast a spell, you must roll a vigor contest against the *mp*
cost of the spell. If you fail, mark a Chrusification point. Once you reach
maximum Chrusificaiton points, your character's lungs and brain turn to gold,
killing them.
