### Contest

Skill contests are one of the most used mechanics in Fen. When asked to roll a skill contest, each "side" rolls a skill, the actor with the higher result wins. A contest is written as `skill_1`/`skill_2` where the first skill, `skill_1` represents the aggressors skill and `skill_2` represents the defenders skill. For example, a fight/vigor contest would have the aggressor roll a fight skill vs. the defender's vigor skill. Ties are in favor of the defender in a "meet or beat" fashion. For example, in a dodge/notice contest (common when hiding), the defender (the one trying to find the hiding actor) wins if they meet or beat the aggressor's (hider's) dodge.

Skill contest can be one aggressor to many defenders. In this case, the aggressor rolls once and each defender rolls separately. The effects of a win or loss apply individually to each defender.

### Die Increments

Some specializations, materials, and traits talk about die increments. Dice exist along a scale separated by increments. These dice can be increased or decreased by an increment. The dice increments in order are as follows:

1. 1d4
2. 1d6
3. 1d8
4. 1d10
5. 1d12
6. 1d20

If a weapon has a trait that increases its die by one increment a weapon with 1d4 becomes 1d6 instead, conversely decreased by one increment would become a 1d8. At number one on the scale a decrease has no effect, similarly when a die reaches a number six on the scale it cannot be increased by any further increments.

### Additional Die

When rolling with one or more additional die, you pick from the dice you are rolling the die with the highest amount of sides. Then you roll one or more additional die of that type.
