  Once you select this specialization, you cannot gain the [Kind of Gold]({{< ref "/core/ref/king-of-gold-specialization.md" >}}) specialization by any means.

  You are a descendant of one of the ancient dwarven Kings of Iron. Not all that descend from the old Kings of Iron have the gift, but by the strength in your hands and the darkness behind your eyes, you do. There is no wrong, strength cannot right.

  You gain [Talent]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization.md" >}}) in [fight]({{< ref "/core/ref/fight-skill.md" >}}) and [vigor])({{< ref "/core/ref/vigor-skill.md" >}}).

  When you use your major action to attack an actor and successfully deal damage, you may also force a fight/vigor contest. On a success the target becomes the defender of the grapple condition with you as the aggressor. Additionally you may roll one additional skill die during any contest while you are effected by the grappled condition. You may not willing end the grapple condition by any means.

  You deal an additional weapon die of damage with weapons made with *cold iron*.
