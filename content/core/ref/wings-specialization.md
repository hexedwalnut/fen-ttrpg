## Description

When you take the [move]({{< ref "/core/ref/move-action.md" >}}) action you can move in any direction including into the air. You take no damage when falling as long as you are not [immobile]({{< ref "/core/ref/immobile-condition.md" >}}) or [unconscious]({{< ref "/core/ref/unconscious-condition.md" >}}). In addition, you can use a minor action to maintain you current height in the air as long as you are not immobile.
