You are gripped by fear and dread. While you have the fear condition, you roll one fewer die on all contests while the source of your fear is within line of sight.

The fear condition is specified with a number. At the end of each of your turns reduce this number by one. If the number is ever zero or less than zero, remove the fear condition.
