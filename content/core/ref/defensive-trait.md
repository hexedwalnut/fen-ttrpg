The weapon or armor grants you [Resistance (X, B, P, S)]({{< ref "/core/ref/resistance-condition.md" >}}) when applying its defense during attacking and defending. This effect happens before applying the defense of the item. For example, if a shield had one defense left and **Defensive (5)** then was attacked for five points of damage, the resistance would reduce damage to zero dealt to the shield. In this case the shield would take no defense damage.
