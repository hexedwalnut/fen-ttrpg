  When you deal damage with a 
  [destructive strike]({{< relref "/core/ref/destructive-strike-action.md" >}})
  major action, you may apply the effects of your 
  [bludgeon]({{< relref "/armory/ref/bludgeon-specialization.md" >}}) specialization
  without spending a reaction. If you succeed on your contest from the bludgeon 
  specialization and the target is under the effects of the  
  [dazed]({{< relref "/core/ref/dazed-condition.md" >}}) condition, they become 
  [incapacitated]({{< relref "/core/ref/incapacitated-condition.md" >}}) until 
  the start of your next turn instead. Likewise, if you succeed on your contest
  from the bludgeon specialization and the target is under the effects of the
  incapacitated condition, they become 
  [unconscious]({{< relref "/core/ref/unconscious-condition.md" >}}).
