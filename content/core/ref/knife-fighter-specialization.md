## Description

You gain an additional die when rolling damage using a weapon 
            with the [short-blade]({{< ref "/core/ref/short-blade.md" >}}) 
            archetype. The type of die is determined by the default sides of 
            the weapon. For example, a standard 
            [Dagger]({{< ref "/core/ref/dagger-weapon.md" >}}) has a weapon die 
            of 1d4. When rolling damage after taking this specialization you 
            instead roll 2d4. If, instead, the weapon had multiple default 
            weapon dice you only add one additional die of the highest sides.
            If a weapon by default rolls 1d4+2d6+3d8 you gain an additional 1d8
            after taking this specialization. This specialization applies to 
            offhanded weapons as well.
