  abstract="Trait for the heaviest of armors, your dodge dice is decremented, and you can apply the armor's defense to area of effects damage."

Your armor restricts movement, your [*dodge*]({{< ref "/core/ref/dodge-skill.md" >}}) is treated as two die increments lower when rolling dodge. You gain [Resistance]({{< ref "/core/ref/resistance-condition.md" >}}) to incoming area of effect damage equal to your armor's defense. For example, if you are in the area of an effect that deals 10 [F]({{< ref "/core/ref/damage-types.md#fire" >}}), and you are wearing Full Plate armor with a defense of 20. You gain Resistance(20, F) for the effect.
