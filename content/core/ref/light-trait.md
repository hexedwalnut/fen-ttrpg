A light weapon can add its damage die to a damage roll when wielded in an off hand. If the light weapon has the Loaded(X) trait, adding the damage die costs ammunition as if you shot the weapon. If the light weapon is a ranged weapon and is used in melee, this provokes and attack of opportunity as normal.

In addition, light weapons can be counseled on an actor's person.
