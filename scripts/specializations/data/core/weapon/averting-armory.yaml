  Pick a weapon archetype X. All weapons in the chosen archetype gains 
  [Defensive(1)]({{< ref "/core/ref/defensive-trait.md" >}}) while you are 
  wielding it.

  If you are taking this specialization again after the first for the same archetype, you instead increase the number of defensive by one for that archetype. For example, if you have taken this specialization two time before for shields and are taking it again, you move from Defensive(2) to Defensive(3).

  If this is not the first time you have taken this specialization **for this archetype**, the cost changes as per the following table:

  | Time | Cost (sp) |
  | ---- | --------- |
  | 1    | 5         |
  | 2    | 10        |
  | 3    | 20        |
  | 4    | 40        |
