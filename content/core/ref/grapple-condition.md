Grapple is a complicated condition that has two parties. The aggressor (in this case the grapple is a positive condition) and the defender (in this case the grapple is a negative condition). 

The actor that initiates the grapple is automatically the aggressor upon entering the condition, meaning the other actors is the defender. While an actor is the aggressor in a grapple, the grapple condition is considered a positive condition, while the defender, grapple is considered a negative condition. 

A grapple offers the following benefits and negatives:

* Both the aggressor and defender are under the effects of [flat-footed]({{< ref "/core/ref/flat-footed-condition.md" >}}) and [immobile]({{< ref "/core/ref/immobile-condition" >}}). 
* Both the aggressor and defender cannot wield two handed weapons, can't deal damage with weapons that don't have the [light]({{< ref "/core/ref/light-trait.md" >}}) trait, and cannot apply the discretionary defenses (i.e., weapons, shields, etc.).

While you are the aggressor:

* The aggressor can use [vigor]({{< ref "/core/ref/vigor-skill.md" >}}) in place of [dodge]({{< ref "/core/ref/dodge-skill.md" >}}) during defending from attacks form the defender.
* The aggressor gains an additional [fight]({{< ref "/core/ref/fight-skill.md" >}}) die to damage rolls. 
* The aggressor can use an major action to move themself and the defender as per the [move]({{< ref "/core/ref/move-action.md" >}}) minor action. This movement is unaffected by the immobile condition.
* The aggressor may use a minor action to force a vigor/vigor contest against the defender. On a success the grapple ends.

While you are the defender:

* The defender can use a minor action to force a fight/vigor contest against the aggressor. On a success the aggressor becomes the defender and the defender becomes the aggressor.
