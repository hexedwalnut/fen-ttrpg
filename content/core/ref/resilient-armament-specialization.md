## Description

Pick an archetype X. You have learned how to best wield a 
weapon when it is close to break. When a weapon is dealt 
enough damage to its defense to be sundered, you may use your
reaction to cause a Vigor/Fight contest between you and the
damage dealer. If you win the contest, the weapon is not 
sundered, instead keeping 1 defense. This reaction cannot be
applied to magical effects that cause damage to armaments.
