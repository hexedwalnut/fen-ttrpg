  Pick a weapon archetype. You gain an 
  [additional]({{< ref "/core/chapters/introduction.md#additional-die" >}}) 
  weapon die when rolling damage using the chosen archetype.

  For example, a standard [Dagger]({{< ref "/core/ref/dagger-weapon.md" >}})
  has a weapon die of 1d4. When rolling damage after taking this specialization
  you instead roll 2d4.

  If this is not the first time you have taken this specialization **for this archetype**, the cost changes as per the following table:

  | Time | Cost (sp) |
  | ---- | --------- |
  | 1    | 5         |
  | 2    | 10        |
  | 3    | 20        |
  | 4    | 40        |
