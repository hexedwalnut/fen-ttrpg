  Once you select this specialization you cannot gain ['true' formian]({{< ref "/core/ref/true-formian-specialization.md" >}}) or [ecdysis]({{< ref "/core/ref/ecdysis-specialization.md" >}}) by any means.

  You have four sets of arm-leg combination limbs, consistent with the web-spinning master craftsmen of the Formian Collective. 

  You have four sets of limbs that can serve as legs or arms. You must use two of these sets of limbs to walk. Though they can function as arms while you are sitting or otherwise immobile. This means that you can wear either boots or gloves on each individual set of limbs. Note the limbs that you wear boots on cannot be used as arms while the boots are equipped. 

  Additionally, you have the ability to spin humanoid sized spiderwebs. You are immune to [immobile]({{< ref "/core/ref/immobile-condition.md" >}}) conditions caused by spider webs. Spinning a web takes a Major action and can produce one of three effects:

  * You produce a glue-like web spray that fires towards a singular target at [close]({{< ref "/core/ref/close.md" >}}) range. This forces a shoot/dodge contest, if you win the target gains the [immobile]({{< ref "/core/ref/immobile-condition.md" >}}) condition until they or another actor remove the webs using a major action that forces a fight/shoot contest between them an you.
  * You produce a long thin web. You shoot a thin strand of web over a [long]({{< ref "/core/ref/long.md" >}}) range. The strand connects to any surface it lands on.
  * You produce a 1 foot by 1 foot square of strong web silk fabric. This fabric is not sticky and can be connected to other webs by taking an additional major action. This silk can be sold or used as a textile in crafting.
