  You retain the stature and build of your halfling ancestors. This includes a short statue (average 60 pounds, and 3' tall) and large harry feet. Armor, especially shoes,  need to be special tailored to halflings, making many off the shelf clothes and armor not fit well if at all.

  You can roll an additional dodge die to defend against an attack from an actor that is larger than you. In addition, you can roll an additional skill die during a contest that would try to knock you over or move you from you current position.
