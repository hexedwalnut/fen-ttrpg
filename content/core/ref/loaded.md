This weapon uses [ammunition]({{< ref "/core/ref/ammunition.md" >}}) to make a ranged attack. Each time you use the weapon to attack you expend one piece of ammunition. The X property is the amount of ammunition you can fire before needing to reload using the [Load]({{<ref "/core/ref/load-action.md" >}}) aggressive action. A loading property of zero (0) means that you can draw the ammunition and fire the weapon as part of one aggressive action.
