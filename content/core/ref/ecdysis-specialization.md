## Description

Once you select this specialization you cannot gain ['true' formian]({{< ref "/core/ref/true-formian-specialization.md" >}}) or [aracnia]({{< ref "/core/ref/aracnia-specialization.md" >}}) by any means.

You are the picture of an Ecdysis nomad, the lower body of a large scorpion, stinger and all, and the upper torso of a humanoid. 

You are a large creature and might find it more difficult to fit into small spaces.

Due to your powerful six-legs you can move extra fast. When [moving]({{< ref "/core/ref/move-action.md" >}}) you instead move 10 times the sides of your [dodge]({{< ref "/core/ref/dodge-skill.md" >}}) instead of five times. This applies to all places that lets you take the move action (i.e., charge).

You have a powerful stinger that acts as a natural weapon. Your stinger is considered an off-handed [short-blade]({{< ref "/core/ref/short-blade-archetype.md" >}}) with the [light]({{< ref "/core/ref/light-trait.md" >}}) trait. It deals 1d6 [P]({{< ref "/core/ref/damage-types.md#piercing" >}}) damage. If you successfully deal damage using the stinger (even while applying its light trait as part of another weapon's damage roll), it deals an additional 3d6 [T]({{< ref "/core/ref/damage-types.md#toxic" >}}) damage to the target.
