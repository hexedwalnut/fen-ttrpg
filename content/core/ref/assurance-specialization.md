## Description

Pick a skill your actor has. Increase the number of dice rolled for this skill by 1. For example, if your actor has 1d6 in the Fight skill, after taking this specialization, your actor would roll 2d6 in the Fight skill. Note, once a skill is selected for Assurance it cannot be selected for [Talent]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization.md" >}}). This means that once you select Assurance on a skill, you can never increase the sides of the die.
