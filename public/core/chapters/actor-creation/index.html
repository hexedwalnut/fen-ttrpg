What is an actor? Actors are any animate or inanimate object, force, or entity that can take actions. The game of Fen looks at all things as a struggle between two or more actors. A fight between two bar patrons, a monstrous climb on a snowy mountain, or searching through the records of a dusty library are all struggles between two or more actors. This differs from other TTRPG systems, most systems treat only animate beings as actors (i.e., PC, NPC, monster). Fen instead looks at actors from a more literary perspective: person vs person, person vs self, person vs nature, etc. Classifying anything that can cause conflict as an actor allows for rules concerning weather events, combat encounters, exploration and navigation, etc., to have a similar feel and core rule-set. So, what is an actor? An actor is anything that would cause conflict for your players, including themselves. Now to the nitty-gritty.

<p>Actors are any animate or inanimate object, force, or entity that can take actions. The game of Fen looks at all things as a struggle between two or more actors. A fight between two bar patrons, a monstrous climb on a snowy mountain, or searching through the records of a dusty library are all struggles between two or more actors. This differs from other TTRPG systems, most systems treat only animate beings as actors (i.e., PC, NPC, monster). Fen instead looks at actors from a more literary perspective: person vs person, person vs self, person vs nature, etc. Classifying anything that can cause conflict as an actor allows for rules concerning weather events, combat encounters, exploration and navigation, etc., to have a similar feel and core rule-set. So, what is an actor? An actor is anything that would cause conflict for your players, including themselves. Now to the nitty-gritty.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-an-actor">What makes an actor?<a href="#what-makes-an-actor" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>The basic makeup of an actor consists of a collection of statistics and skills.</p>
<h3 id="statistics">Statistics<a href="#statistics" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Statistics describe a limited resource that an actor has at their disposal. These can be either physical resources, like Hit Point (<em>hp</em>) or intangible resources such as Specialization Points (<em>sp</em>).</p>
<h4 id="hit-points">Hit Points<a href="#hit-points" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p><em>hp</em> represents the total amount of effort an actor can exert to stop an action from killing or harming them. Every actor has a maximum <em>hp</em> and tracks their current <em>hp</em>.</p>
<h4 id="specialization-points">Specialization Points<a href="#specialization-points" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p><em>sp</em> represents the current training an actor has. This can be thought of as <em>xp</em> from other TTRPGs. <em>sp</em> is used to purchase specializations and customize a actor&rsquo;s abilities. Every actor tracks their current amount of <em>sp</em> as they earn and spend it.</p>
<h4 id="regional-or-temporal-statistics">Regional or Temporal Statistics<a href="#regional-or-temporal-statistics" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Some campaigns or regions can add statistics. The GM will list these statistics at the start of character creation.</p>
<h3 id="skills">Skills<a href="#skills" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>Skills represent a collection of actions an actor might take by rolling an associated die (dice) when directed. These skills change with the age of the game and/or region the game is located in (determined by the GM), but several skills are default across all ages, locations and actors.</p>
<p>Note that not all actors will have all skills, but all actors have default skills. An actor without a particular skill rolls a 1d4 if required to roll for the purposes of an action or specialization.</p>
<p>The default skills are the skills all actors have regardless of time or region:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#articulate">Articulate</a></li>
<li><a href="#cognition">Cognition</a></li>
<li><a href="#dodge">Dodge</a></li>
<li><a href="#fight">Fight</a></li>
<li><a href="#notice">Notice</a></li>
<li><a href="#shoot">Shoot</a></li>
<li><a href="#vigor">Vigor</a></li>
<li><a href="#will">Will</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Skills are tied to a die that represents proficiency. A die with more sides represents that an actor has a higher degree of expertise in that skill.</p>
<h4 id="articulate">Articulate<a href="#articulate" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Articulate represents the actor&rsquo;s ability to navigate social or interpersonal relationships. This includes an actor&rsquo;s ability to deceive, persuade, explain, or otherwise articulate a coherent point verbally or through social interaction. Articulate represents the summation of an actor&rsquo;s social skills. Articulate could also represent how an actor is perceived. For example, a faction or region with a high articulate might be perceived better than a faction or region with a low articulate.</p>
<h4 id="cognition">Cognition<a href="#cognition" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Cognition represents the ability for an actor to pull pieces of information together, notice patters, or perform complex mental tasks. This skill is raw intellect and processing power. This skill can also represent how logical or rational a system is. A faction with a high cognition might appreciate a more logical or rational argument. A region with high cognition might be structured well, with clear roads and boundaries.</p>
<h4 id="dodge">Dodge<a href="#dodge" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Dodge represents an actor&rsquo;s ability to move dexterously or evade danger. Dodge is an important part of defending yourself from harm (see &ldquo;Combat&rdquo; chapter) but also represents an actor&rsquo;s ability to move quickly, balance, perform tasks associated with acrobatics, or move stealthily. A storm with a high dodge skill can move quickly or strike fast. A faction with a high dodge could travel quickly or be somewhat stealthy.</p>
<h4 id="fight">Fight<a href="#fight" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Fight represents an actor&rsquo;s ability to cause damage adjacent to another actor (i.e., hit them with a stick). Fight might also represent verbal threats or raw physical might. Fight is used in combat. A faction with a high fight might hold a lot of military might, or be prone to acts of violence.</p>
<h4 id="notice">Notice<a href="#notice" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Notice represents an actor&rsquo;s ability to see, perceive, and find objects. Notice also represents the degree to which an actor is paying attention. A faction with a high notice might have spies or other such mechanisms to find out the secrets of another faction.</p>
<h4 id="shoot">Shoot<a href="#shoot" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Shoot represents the ability to cause damage to another actor from a distance. This skill also represents the actor&rsquo;s accuracy and ability to aim. A faction with a high shoot normally engages from a longer range in combat.</p>
<h4 id="tactics">Tactics<a href="#tactics" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Tactics represents the actor&rsquo;s tactical knowledge and intuition. It often denotes a more crafty view of combat. A faction with a high tactics would have clever generals and commanders.</p>
<h4 id="vigor">Vigor<a href="#vigor" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Vigor represents an actor&rsquo;s steadfastness and heartiness towards physical conditions. A faction with high vigor might have increased stores or resources.</p>
<h4 id="will">Will<a href="#will" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Will represents an actor&rsquo;s steadfastness and heartiness towards mental conditions.
A faction with high a will might have an increased sense of belonging or good internal relations.</p>
<h4 id="regional-or-temporal-skill">Regional or Temporal Skill<a href="#regional-or-temporal-skill" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h4>
<p>Different campaigns might add other skills that actors can utilize. These skills will be listed by the GM during character creation.</p>
