## Description

Pick an armor archetype X. You have learned how to best wear this armor when its 
close to break. When an armor is deal enough damage to its defense to be 
sundered, you may use your reaction to cause a Vigor/Fight contest between you 
and the damage dealer. If you win the contest, the armor is not sundered, 
instead keeping 1 defense. This reaction cannot be applied to magical effects 
that cause damage to armor.

Taking this specialization more than once for the same archetype has no extra 
effect. The cost of this specialization does not increase when you buy it 
another time.
