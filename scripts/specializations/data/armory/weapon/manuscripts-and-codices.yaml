  You gain the four guards of
  [long-blade]({{< relref "/core/ref/long-blade-archetype.md" >}}): Plow, Ox, Fool,
  and Boar.

  * **Plow**: A primarily defensive guard, your blade held low across your body
  ready to block incoming blows. While in Plow you may use 
  [vigor]({{< relref "/core/ref/vigor-skill.md" >}}) dice in place of 
  [dodge]({{< relref "/core/ref/dodge-skill.md" >}}) dice when defending.
  * **Ox**: A primarily offensive guard, your blade held high above your head
  point out. While in Ox you may add an additional 
  [fight]({{< relref "/core/ref/fight-skill.md" >}}) die to damage rolls.
  * **Fool**: A defensive guard that tries to lure in attackers, your blade held
  pointing to the ground. While in Fool long-blade weapons gain the 
  [counter]({{< relref "/core/ref/counter-trait.md" >}}) trait while you are 
  wielding them.
  * **Boar**: A offensive guard focused on spacing and maneuvering, your sword held
  straight towards your target. While in boar your movement doesn't provoke attacks
  of opportunity

  You can enter a guard as a minor action gaining the benefits as stated above.
