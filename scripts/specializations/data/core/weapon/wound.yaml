  Pick a weapon archetype X. When you cause damage with a weapon from your selected
  archetype, you may use your reaction to cause a fight contest versus the
  defender's vigor or dodge. On a success your target takes one point of *wp*
  and gains the [wounded]({{< ref "/core/ref/wounded-condition.md" >}}).

  Taking this specialization more than once for the same archetype as no
  additional effect. The cost of this specialization does not increase when you 
  purchase it again.
