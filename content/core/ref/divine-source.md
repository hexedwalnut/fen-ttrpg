*Also known as: Clerical, Liturgical, or Outer source.*

The smell of incense and the sound of church bells. You pace the halls of the vestibule, dark with the revelation of last night's dream. All the preparation, ceremonies, and teachings gone for one night. The voice said that you are special, that you must break away. The voice promised great things. Today you should be a priest, as was ordained when you entered seminary, but the dream, the voice. You hold your breath and do as the voice told. Magic sparks for your hands and ignites the sigil, the smell of incense is replaced with brimstone, and the sound of church bells with deadly screeches. "Good," the voice overcomes the yelling from outside, "Now, there is work to be done."

The divine source is a source of magic that lets a conduit (magic caster) draw from the immense magical power of a god or divinity (good or evil). This source often has a specific divinity that the conduit pulls from, in that case the conduit should look over the [divinity]({{< ref "/wiki/divinities.md" >}}) list and select a divinity to worship. In the divinity's page there will be a list of minor, major, and great source triggers for the conduit to pull from in addition to the ones in the generic triggers listed below. Otherwise a conduit can pull only from the general divinity (i.e., a minor local god without specific triggers, a sense of spirituality without a specific divinity, etc.) using the following general triggers.

## Generic Minor Triggers

The generic divine source has the following minor triggers:

- **Prayer**: Any ritual activity that constitutes a connection with your divinity. Prayer might look like the formulaic prayers, chants, or reading, minor sacrificial offerings, or some sort of minor group ritual. This activity takes an hour to preform and requires a hollowed or sacred space. This hollowed or sacred space need not be a church or man-made structure, but should be designated to your divinity or spirituality in some way.
- **Service**: Any act of service (i.e., giving money to the poor, cleaning a temple or city street, etc.). This act of service should align with your divinity in some way and need not be broadly helpful or impactful to count as a minor trigger. This should take no less than three hours to preform.

## Generic Major Triggers

The generic divine source has the following major triggers:

- **Initiation**: You convert one or more actors to your faith. This is accomplished through a three hour ceremony in a hollowed or sacred space as described in *Prayer* above. Once you receive mp from this trigger you cannot do it again for 24 hours. The converts must be willing creatures and understand fully the commitment and responsibilities innate in becoming a member of your faith.
- **Oath**: Take a new divine promise as an oath. This oath must constitute a new and difficult challenge. This oath can be anything the actor decides but must be reviewed by the GM. Oaths must have a decidable end date and clear objectives. There are consequences if the conduit cannot deliver on the oath. You cannot have more than one oath active at any given time. Oaths taken in this way require a three hour ceremony and must be accomplished in a hollowed or sacred space as described in *Prayer* above.
- **Crusade**: You and your companions slay, best, or defeat one or more enemies of your divinity. These enemies can include monsters, humanoids, or spirits. As a general rule, unless the actor that is slain was a direct competitor or enemy of your divinity or working on behalf of a direct competitor or enemy of your divinity, it does not count towards this trigger. This is triggered at the end of a combat.

## Generic Great Triggers

The generic divine source has the following great triggers:

- **Pilgrimage**: You travel to the source of your divinity or to a particularly special place for your divinity. This is often listed in the divinity list entry for your divinity, or can be agreed upon between the actor and GM. You gain a full refill of your mp by resting in this specific special place. In addition, if this is your first time resting at this specific special place, you gain temporary mp equal to three times your mp maximum.
- **Temple**: You establish a hollow or sacred space for your divinity. This takes a significant amount of time requiring either the construction of a building or structure or a significant amount of materials. Generally this takes  years to accomplish. Refurbishing or re-constructing an existing temple, or reclaiming a defaced temple can take less time and requires less resource, but still counts towards this trigger. Upon completing the temple, you regain all your spent mp and gain temporary mp equal to your mp maximum.
