*Also known as: Primal, Druidic, or Elemental source.*

You have always been good when left along. Known to take long strolls through the woods when the work on the farm was done. People always warned you of the dangers of the wild places, but they never seemed to harm you. You would sit by the old-man oaks near the stream, and listen to their stories. They spoke of the quite way, the unspoken art. Over the years the voices have become much loader, but they started no louder than the babbling stream. Now you hear them when cutting down the wheat planted by your father. You think you can hear them too. It never occurred to you that the oaks never spoke to anyone else till the saws came. The screams sang louder than the splitting earth or thunder claps. It was instinct when the art was made incarnate, it was something deep within. The lumberjacks pleaded, "We did not know," they said ", a wild-man protected this forest." Nevertheless, their bodies fertilized the ground for new oaks to grow.

The natural source pulls from the magic power of Fen itself. Note an important distinction here, this source does not pull from a god associated with nature, it pulls from the innate magic of nature and seeing, feeling, and experiencing its effects. This means that a conduit that pulls from the natural source must bear witness to the workings of Fen and draws their magic from this practice. A conduit with the natural source can pull magic using the following triggers:

## Minor Triggers

- **Mindfulness**: The act of being in nature, and meditating on its majesty is enough to pull some magic from this source. In a secluded portion of nature (not within six miles of a settlement) you can spend one hour meditating and observing nature to trigger this minor trigger. No special location or materials are needed as long as your are secluded enough, the actions of your fellow companions does not effect the seclusion of an area as long as you haven't build permanent structures. This need not be quite, but must be your whole attention.
- **Gardening**: Cultivating or germinating new growth, either in a classical garden or in a less structured way can offer a bit of magical power. The act of planting a native, non-invasive, and naturally occurring plant triggers a minor trigger. This should take no less then 15 minutes.
- **Animal Encounter**: Encountering a wild animal in a friendly and positive way triggers a minor trigger. This cannot be accomplished while hunting, but can be accomplished while gathering. An actor can seek this out through one hour of hiking.

## Major Triggers

- **Powerful Location**: You rest at a location of natural power. The GM has the final say on what constitutes a powerful location. Some examples of powerful locations include:
    - Volcanoes/Geysers 
    - Near/On Rapids
    - High in the Mountains
    - In the Open Desert
    - Dense Jungle/Forest
- **Powerful Event**: You witness a powerful natural event. The GM has the final say on what constitutes a powerful event. Some examples of powerful natural events include:
    - Large storms
    - Volcanic eruptions
    - Tornadoes 
    - Hurricanes

## Great Triggers

- **Natural Wonders**: There are [Eight Natural Wonders]({{< ref "/wiki/eight-natural-wonders.md" >}}) of Fen. Resting at one of these natural wonders give you a full refill of your *mp*. In addition, if this is the first time you have rested at a specific natural wonder, you gain temporary *mp* equal to three times your max *mp*. The eight natural wonders include:
    1. [**Hali Falls**]({{< ref "/wiki/hali-falls.md" >}}): The largest waterfalls in Fen, they begin near the source of the Hali river.
    2. [**JÃ¶tunnhrauun**]({{< ref "/wiki/jotunnhrauun.md" >}}): A string of islands that boast the largest volcanoes in Fen.
    3. [**Obol Great Reef**]({{< ref "/wiki/obol-great-reef.md" >}}): The largest reef in Fen, which also so happens to be in-land in the sunken continent of the Obolo.
    4. [**Malfrost**]({{< ref "/wiki/malfrost.md" >}}): The northern regions of Heartbrooke that is in a perpetual state of winter.
    5. [**Mount Redcap**]({{< ref "/wiki/mount-redcap.md" >}}): The tallest natural peak in Fen. The mountain is completely made of red rock.
    7. [**Owli Cannon**]({{< ref "/wiki/owli-cannon.md" >}}): The largest cannon in Fen. This cannon cuts off the Saurisozan swamp from the Owli Plains.
    8. [**Mother's Cradle**]({{< ref "/wiki/mothers-cradle.md" >}}): A series of long winding rivers in a fertile valley. 
- **Once in a Lifetime**: "Once in a lifetime events" include things that are naturally occurring but only happen infrequently, this includes volcanic eruptions from dormant volcanoes, comets or total eclipses, strange or extra strong weather events or storms, large earth quakes, etc. These events must be witnessed while they are happening (i.e., not just the aftermath). You gain a full refill of your *mp*. In addition you gain temporary *mp* equal to two times your max *mp*.
