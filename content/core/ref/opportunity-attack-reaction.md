You may use your reaction to make a melee attack against an actor within your range that uses a [Use Unequipped Item]({{< ref "/core/ref/use-unequipped-item-action.md" >}}) major action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves your melee range. Roll a melee attack against the triggering actor as per the [Attack]({{< ref "/core/ref/attack-action.md" >}}) major action.
