  You gain a natural armor while wearing no other armor. Your natural armor, exoskeleton, has 12 defense, [unarmored]({{< ref "/core/ref/unarmored-archetype.md" >}}), and the [comfortable]({{< ref "/core/ref/comfortable-trait.md" >}}) trait.

  If the armor is reduced to zero defense, you take one point of *wp* and gain the [wounded]({{< ref "/core/ref/wounded-condition.md" >}}) condition. Your natural armor heals two points of defense damage per day.
