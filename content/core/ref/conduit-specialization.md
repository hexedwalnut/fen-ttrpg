## Description

Your actor becomes a magical conduit, and gains the ability to 
cast spells. When you select this specialization you gain the following:

* **Magic Skill**: The [magic skill]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}})
represents your ability to cast, understand, and control magical sources, spells,
phenomena, and creatures. 
* **Magic Point Statistic**: Works much like hit points, but instead of 
representing available effort to avoid death, it represents your total ability
to cast or preform magic spells.* **Primary Source**: The source you pull most of your magic from.
* **Starting Spell List**: A list of default spells that you know how to cast.

## Magic Skill

When you take this specialization you gain the [magic skill]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}}).
Like stated above, this represents your ability to cast, understand, and control
magical sources, spells, phenomena, and creatures. You initially have a magic
skill of 1d6, it can be increased via the normal means (i.e., [talent specialization]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization" >}})).

## Magic Point Statistic (mp)

When you take this specialization you gain the magic point statistic. This
represents the total amount of magical ability you have at the current time.
You spend mp to cast spells or to channel magical power. You regain mp by 
engaging with your source. When you take this specialization you gain a maximum
mp of a non-explosive [magic]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}}) roll. 
This maximum can be increased via the [magic well specialization]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-well-specialization.md" >}}).

## Primary Source

As described in the [Magic]({{< ref "/core/chapters/magic.md" >}}) chapter, 
each conduit has a source where they pull their power from. Select one on of the
following sources as your actor's primary source:

- [Divine Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/divine-source.md" >}}): You pull your magic
from a god or other divinity. This source allows you to gain magic from the
worship of something greater than yourself and through your connection with 
you divinity.
- [Natural Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/natural-source.md" >}}): You pull your
magic from the forces of nature itself. This source allows you to gain magic from
natural landmarks and forces and through your deep connection and understanding
of nature and its processes.
- [Collective Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/collective-source.md" >}}): You pull
your magic from the collective study of magic and its proprieties. This source
allows you to gain magic from deep study, collective debate and experimentation,
and the books, papers, and media produced by like minds and the magical 
collective.
- [Sacrificial Source]({{<ref "/core/ref/sacrificial-source.md" >}}): You pull
your magic from self-sacrificial acts. You gain magic from your willingness to
give as much as you take, trading your bodily and mental health from magical 
power, a fair but brutal bargain.

### Pure Source (needs GM approval)

You pull from the pure source as your primary source. This allows you to move
fluidly between any of the above sources. You can pull freely from any of the 
above sources.

## Starting Spell List

No conduit is alone in their manifestations of magical spells. You gain a
starting spell list based on your interests. Select one spell list from those 
featured below.
