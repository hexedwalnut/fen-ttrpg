Dodge represents an actor's ability to move dexterously or evade danger. Dodge is an important part of defending yourself from harm (see "Combat" chapter) but also represents an actor's ability to move quickly, balance, perform tasks associated with acrobatics, or move stealthily. A storm with a high dodge skill can move quickly or strike fast. A faction with a high dodge could travel quickly or be somewhat stealthy.
