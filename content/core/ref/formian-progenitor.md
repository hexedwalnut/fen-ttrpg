The Formian progenitor consists of all insectoid people on Fen. Formians are divinely created insect and arachnid people that usually live in large collective communities connected by telepathic bond and worship a pantheon of once mortal queens and demigods. They include:

* "true" Formians: insect-like six limbed people
* Ecdysis: scorpion-folk six legged scorpion centaurs with a venomous tail
* Aracnia: spider-like eight arm-leg hybrid limbs and web-spinning abilities
* Xi'Fosra: forsaken sea/coast-dwelling crustacean-like group of diverse Formians. 

All Formians besides the Xi'Fosra, communicate via a combination of innate magical ability and chemical impulses known as Pheromosis. This collective communication keeps Formians within the same location connected and aware of each others feelings, thoughts, and wants. Pheromosis is the means by which a group of Formians bond, produce culture, and coordinate tasks. As such, from an outside perspective, Formians are viewed as a hive-mind, with little outside will or freedom. This is, in fact, not quite the case. While a group of Formians will create a collective mind via Pheromosis, their will and actions are still their own. It is best thought of as a network of information and surveillance, which often influences behavior, but does not determine it. A Formian without a group of other Formian is not influenced by Pheromosis. 

Additionally, Formians are unique in that they require a queen to reproduce. While "queen" is the term used by those outside the Formian collective, queen may denote a gender, which is not truly of concern to the Formians. From those outside, the leaders of Formian society also gave "birth" to all the new Formian young, which lead outsiders to call them queens (i.e., female leader). But more appropriately, Formian "queens" are neither male or female in the reproductive sense, and instead are more of a host, in that, the queen has the ability to give "birth" to new Formians when they have access to many other Formians with the correct reproductive parts. Additionally, while it is likely for the 'true' Formians, Ecdysis, and Aracnia to have their own queens that look sometime like the group from which they originate, the queen can "birth" any type of Formian as the collective needs. Formian queens are often considered part divinity by their collective and protected at all costs.

## What is up with the Xi'Fosra

Near the beginning of the Formians, a group led by a rogue and scoundrel, later the god Ordog, trickster god, defied the Formian Pantheon by disguising himself as Vis Alta, water god, to create, with Aracnia Hyr, all the monsters of the world. The group which Ordog used to legitimize his disguise were cursed to ever walk the shores and seas alone and disconnected from the hive. Aracnia Hyr cut the group from the rest, and banished them far from the warm sands to walk the cold, and to never return. As such they do not have the Pheromosis connection that other Formians have.

## Creating a Formian 

Unlike many progenitors, Formians have to select to either be a member of the banished Xi'Fosra or the Collective before continuing to select progenitor specializations. 

### Creating a Xi'Fosra

The Xi'Fosra do not gain the [Pheromosis]({{< ref "/core/ref/pheromosis-specialization.md" >}}) specialization and cannot by any means gain the effect. Xi'Fosra gain the [Xi'Fosra Curse]({{< ref "/core/ref/xifosra-curse-specialization.md" >}}) without spending any *sp*. You then you gain 10 *sp*. Xi'Fosra look like a wide variety of water bugs and crustaceans. Write a few words on your character sheet to describe your character, if you want, specify a species of water bug or crustacean that best describes your general look. Then select any number of progenitor specializations you feel fit your character using the 10 *sp*.

### Creating a member of the Collective

The Collective is any descendant of the Formian progenitors that have [Pheromosis]({{< ref "/core/ref/pheromosis-specialization.md" >}}). You cannot gain the [Xi'Fosra Curse]({{< ref "/core/ref/xifosra-curse-specialization.md" >}}) through any means, and gain the [Pheromosis]({{< ref "/core/ref/pheromosis-specialization.md" >}}) specialization without spending any *sp*. You then gain 10 *sp*. Formians looks like all manner of flightless insects and arachnids, including ants, spiders, beetles, etc. Generally Formians fall into three general categories: "true" Formians, insects with one pair of legs and two sets of arms which look like either ants or some other six legged insect, Ecdysis, the body of a scorpion and the upper torso of a humanoid, and Aracnia, spider-like, eight limbed web spinners. There is high overlap between Aracnia and "True" Formians as to where they live and their place in society, whereas Ecdysis tends to be secluded, nomadic, and militaristic. Write a few words on your character sheet to describe your character, if you want, specify a species of insect or arachnid that best describes your general look. Then select any number of progenitor specializations you feel fit your character using the 10 *sp*.

Additionally Collective Formians cannot gain a swim speed by any means and automatically fail any contest to swim.
