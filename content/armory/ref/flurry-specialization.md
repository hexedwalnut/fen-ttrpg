## Description

If you deal damage with a 
[short-blade]({{< relref "/core/ref/short-blade-archetype.md" >}}) weapon while a
short-blade is in your off-hand. You may use your reaction to roll another attack
using the off-hand short-blade. When making the additional attack with the 
off-hand short-blade the original main-hand short-blade counts as an off-hand
short-blade.
