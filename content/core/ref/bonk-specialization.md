## Description

When you deal damage with a destructive strike major action.
You apply the effects of your bludgeon specialization. If the target
has the [*dazed*]({{<ref "/core/ref/dazed-condition.md" >}}) condition they
become [*incapacitated*]({{< ref "/core/ref/incapacitated-condition.md" >}})
until the end of your next turn. If they are *incapacitated* they become 
[*unconscious*]({{< ref "/core/ref/unconscious-condition.md" >}}).
