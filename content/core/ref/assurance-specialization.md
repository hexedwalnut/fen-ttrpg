## Description

Pick a skill your actor has. Increase the number of dice rolled for this skill
by 1. For example, if your actor has 1d6 in the 
[Fight]({{< ref "/core/ref/fight-skill.md" >}}) skill, after taking this 
specialization, your actor would roll 2d6 in the Fight skill. 

Note, once a skill is selected for Assurance it cannot be selected for 
[Talent]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization.md" >}}). This means that
once your select Assurance on a skill, you can never increase the sides of the
die.

If this is not the first time you have taken this specialization, it costs two 
*sp* extra for each past purchase. For example, if you have selected this
specialization two times for the Fight skill and one time for the 
[Shoot]({{< ref "/core/ref/shoot-skill.md" >}}) skill, the next purchase of this
specialization will cost 8 *sp*.
