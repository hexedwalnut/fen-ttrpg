Cognition represents the ability for an actor to pull pieces of information together, notice patters, or perform complex mental tasks. This skill is raw intellect and processing power. This skill can also represent how logical or rational a system is. A faction with a high cognition might appreciate a more logical or rational argument. A region with high cognition might be structured logically, with clear roads and boundaries.
