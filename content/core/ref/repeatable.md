The *Repeatable* keyword allows for a specialization to be purchased multiple times. A specialization marked as *Repeatable* can be bought any number of times for one actor. A specialization marked as *Repeatable(X)*, where *X* is some whole number, represents that a specialization can be taken a maximum of *X* number of times. The *sp* cost of a *Repeatable* specialization increases each time you purchase it. Unless otherwise stated in the specialization, the cost is equal to the base cost times the total number of *Repeatable* an actor will have after purchasing the specialization. For example, if an actor has a *Repeatable* specialization that originally cost 100 *sp*, the actor would have to spend 200 *sp* to take the specialization again. If they instead had taken the *Repeatable* specialization two times, they would have to spend 300 *sp* to purchase the specialization again.
