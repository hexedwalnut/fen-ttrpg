+++

The Saurisosan progenitor consists of reptilian humanoids of all kinds. Saurisosans are divinely created by the Celestial Emperor, though they have been rebuked by the god after they betrayed him in favor of the Wind God Notos, father of all sea monsters. Saurisosans span a wide gamut of reptiles and can vary widely in size and shape. They can look like most reptiles.

## Creating a Saurisosan

When you select this progenitor, you gain 10 *sp*. Saurisosans span a wide range of looks, heights, and builds. Write a few words on your character sheet to describe your character, if you want, you can specify a type of reptile that your character most resembles. Then select any number of progenitor specializations you think fit your character using the 10 *sp*.
