## What is an actor?

Actors are any animate or inanimate object, force, or entity that can take actions. The game of Fen looks at all things as a struggle between two or more actors. A fight between two bar patrons, a monstrous climb on a snowy mountain, or searching through the records of a dusty library are all struggles between two or more actors. This differs from other TTRPG systems, most systems treat only animate beings as actors (i.e., PC, NPC, monster). Fen instead looks at actors from a more literary perspective: person vs person, person vs self, person vs nature, etc. Classifying anything that can cause conflict as an actor allows for rules concerning weather events, combat encounters, exploration and navigation, etc., to have a similar feel and core rule-set. So, what is an actor? An actor is anything that would cause conflict for your players, including themselves. Now to the nitty-gritty.

## What makes an actor? 

The basic makeup of an actor consists of a collection of statistics and skills.

### Statistics

Statistics describe a limited resource that an actor has at their disposal. These can be either physical resources, like Hit Point (*hp*) or intangible resources such as Specialization Points (*sp*). Statistic come in three kinds: a *Pool*, *Count* and *Tally*.

#### Pool

A *Pool* is a collection of points that represents a finite resource. A Pool has a maximum value and a current value. For example, hit points are considered a Pool statistic. Generally actors want as many points in a pool statistic as they can get. 

#### Temporary Points

Pools can hold at maximum a finite sum of points in the usual case, however a Pool statistic can gain temporary points. If an effects adds temporary points to a Pool statistic, you gain an additional amount of points equal to the points described. This addition does not increase your current or total points in the Pool. When spending points from this Pool you must remove points from the temporary points before you take points from your regular Pool. Once all temporary points are gone, you remove from the regular pool again. If another source give you temporary points when you already have some, you add the new amount to your temporary points.

#### Hit Points (*hp*)

All actors have the Pool statistic Hit Points (*hp*). *hp* represents the total amount of effort an actor can exert to stop an action from killing or harming them. In the case of non-creature actors (i.e., storms, environments, etc.), *hp* represents the general ability for an actor to remain the way that they are. For example, a storm with low current *hp* might be soon to break, or an environment with low *hp* might be polluted or close to collapse.

### Count

A *Count* statistic is a running amount of a resource that does not have a maximum. A Count only has a current value. For example specialization points are a Count statistic. Generally actors want as many points in a Count statistic as they can.

#### Specialization Points 

*sp* represents the current training an actor has. This can be thought of as *xp* from other TTRPGs. *sp* is used to purchase specializations and customize a actor's abilities. Every actor tracks their current amount of *sp* as they earn and spend it.

### Tally

A *Tally* statistic is a running amount with a maximum, where something happens when the count reaches its maximum. For example, wounds are a Tally statistic. Generally actors want a few tally points as possible.

#### Wound Points (*wp*)

A wound point *wp* represents physical bodily health. Actors have a maximum of half the sides of their vigor die for *wp*. 

### Regional or Temporal Statistics

Some campaigns or regions can add statistics. The GM will list these statistics at the start of character creation.

### Skills

Skills represent a collection of actions an actor might take by rolling an associated die (dice) when directed. These skills change with the age of the game and/or region the game is located in (determined by the GM), but several skills are default across all ages, locations and actors.

Note that not all actors will have all skills, but all actors have default skills. An actor without a particular skill rolls a 1d4 if required to roll for the purposes of an action or specialization.

The default skills are the skills all actors have regardless of time or region:

- [Articulate]({{< ref "#articulate" >}})
- [Cognition]({{< ref "#cognition" >}})
- [Dodge]({{< ref "#dodge" >}})
- [Fight]({{< ref "#fight" >}})
- [Notice]({{< ref "#notice" >}})
- [Shoot]({{< ref "#shoot" >}})
- [Vigor]({{< ref "#vigor" >}})
- [Will]({{< ref "#will" >}})

Skills are tied to a die that represents proficiency. A die with more sides represents that an actor has a higher degree of expertise in that skill.

#### Articulate

Articulate represents the actor's ability to navigate social or interpersonal relationships. This includes an actor's ability to deceive, persuade, explain, or otherwise articulate a coherent point verbally or through social interaction. Articulate represents the summation of an actor's social skills. Articulate could also represent how an actor is perceived. For example, a faction or region with a high articulate might be perceived better than a faction or region with a low articulate.

#### Cognition

Cognition represents the ability for an actor to pull pieces of information together, notice patters, or perform complex mental tasks. This skill is raw intellect and processing power. This skill can also represent how logical or rational a system is. A faction with a high cognition might appreciate a more logical or rational argument. A region with high cognition might be structured well, with clear roads and boundaries.

#### Dodge

Dodge represents an actor's ability to move dexterously or evade danger. Dodge is an important part of defending yourself from harm (see "Combat" chapter) but also represents an actor's ability to move quickly, balance, perform tasks associated with acrobatics, or move stealthily. A storm with a high dodge skill can move quickly or strike fast. A faction with a high dodge could travel quickly or be somewhat stealthy.

#### Fight

Fight represents an actor's ability to cause damage adjacent to another actor (i.e., hit them with a stick). Fight might also represent verbal threats or raw physical might. Fight is used in combat. A faction with a high fight might hold a lot of military might, or be prone to acts of violence.

#### Notice

Notice represents an actor's ability to see, perceive, and find objects. Notice also represents the degree to which an actor is paying attention. A faction with a high notice might have spies or other such mechanisms to find out the secrets of another faction.

#### Shoot

Shoot represents the ability to cause damage to another actor from a distance. This skill also represents the actor's accuracy and ability to aim. A faction with a high shoot normally engages from a longer range in combat.

#### Tactics

Tactics represents the actor's tactical knowledge and intuition. It often denotes a more crafty view of combat. A faction with a high tactics would have clever generals and commanders.

#### Vigor

Vigor represents an actor's steadfastness and heartiness towards physical conditions. A faction with high vigor might have increased stores or resources.

#### Will

Will represents an actor's steadfastness and heartiness towards mental conditions.
A faction with high a will might have an increased sense of belonging or good internal relations.

#### Regional or Temporal Skill

Different campaigns might add other skills that actors can utilize. These skills will be listed by the GM during character creation.

## Creating a Player Character

To create a player character (PC) you use the following steps:

1. Pick a species and gain species specializations
2. Pick an origin and gain origin specializations (pick languages)
3. Determine initial talents for your skills
4. Roll initial hit points
5. Roll for starting money and buy equipment 
6. Gain initial specialization points and purchase specialization 
7. Name your character and come up with a backstory (if needed)

The GM then determines a few things:

1. Your character's maximum life-span and date of death if nothing else kills you first.
2. The GM can give you any other specializations that makes sense for your character based on backstory, alternately the GM might give you additional specialization points to start the game.

## Advancement

## Death and Dying

If damage causes you to fall to zero hit points, you gain one *wp* and the [wounded]({{< ref "/core/ref/wounded-condition.md" >}}) condition. Each time you take damage while at zero hit point, you gain another *wp* and the wounded condition if you don't already have it.
