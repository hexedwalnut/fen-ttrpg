## Description

When you deal damage with a cudgel weapon, you may use your 
reaction to force a Fight/Vigor contest. If you win, the defender suffers the
[*dazed*]({{< ref "core/ref/dazed-condition.md" >}}) until the end of your 
next turn. If you take this specialization again, you increase the number of 
rounds your target is affected by *dazed* by one.
