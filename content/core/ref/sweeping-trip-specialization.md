## Description

As part of taking the [Sweep]({{< ref "/core/ref/sweep-action.md" >}}) 
action, you force a fight/dodge contest against each target. Any target that
loses the contest gains the [*prone*]({{< ref "/core/ref/prone-condition.md" >}}) 
condition. The effect of the *prone* condition is applied after the sweep damage
is dealt.
