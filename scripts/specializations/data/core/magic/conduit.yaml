  Your actor becomes a magical conduit, and gains the ability to 
  cast spells. When you select this specialization you gain the following:

  * **Magic Skill**: The [magic skill]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}})
  represents your ability to cast, understand, and control magical sources, spells,
  phenomena, and creatures. 
  * **Magic Point Statistic**: Works much like hit points, but instead of 
  representing available effort to avoid death, it represents your total ability
  to cast or preform magic spells.* **Primary Source**: The source you pull most of your magic from.
  * **Starting Spell List**: A list of default spells that you know how to cast.

  ### Magic Skill

  When you take this specialization you gain the [magic skill]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}}).
  Like stated above, this represents your ability to cast, understand, and control
  magical sources, spells, phenomena, and creatures. You initially have a magic
  skill of 1d6, it can be increased via the normal means (i.e., [talent specialization]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization" >}})).

  ### Magic Point Statistic (mp)

  When you take this specialization you gain the magic point statistic. This
  represents the total amount of magical ability you have at the current time.
  You spend mp to cast spells or to channel magical power. You regain mp by 
  engaging with your source. When you take this specialization you gain a maximum
  mp of a non-explosive [magic]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}}) roll. 
  This maximum can be increased via the [magic well specialization]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-well-specialization.md" >}}).

  ### Primary Source

  As described in the [Magic]({{< ref "/core/chapters/magic.md" >}}) chapter, 
  each conduit has a source where they pull their power from. Select one on of the
  following sources as your actor's primary source:

  - [Divine Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/divine-source.md" >}}): You pull your magic
  from a god or other divinity. This source allows you to gain magic from the
  worship of something greater than yourself and through your connection with 
  you divinity.
  - [Natural Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/natural-source.md" >}}): You pull your
  magic from the forces of nature itself. This source allows you to gain magic from
  natural landmarks and forces and through your deep connection and understanding
  of nature and its processes.
  - [Collective Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/collective-source.md" >}}): You pull
  your magic from the collective study of magic and its proprieties. This source
  allows you to gain magic from deep study, collective debate and experimentation,
  and the books, papers, and media produced by like minds and the magical 
  collective.
  - [Sacrificial Source]({{<ref "/core/ref/sacrificial-source.md" >}}): You pull
  your magic from self-sacrificial acts. You gain magic from your willingness to
  give as much as you take, trading your bodily and mental health from magical 
  power, a fair but brutal bargain.

  #### Pure Source (needs GM approval)

  You pull from the pure source as your primary source. This allows you to move
  fluidly between any of the above sources. You can pull freely from any of the 
  above sources.
