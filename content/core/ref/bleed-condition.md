At the start of your turn roll 1dX as determined by the condition. You automatically take that much [I]({{< ref "/core/ref/damage-types.md#internal" >}}) damage to hp without the ability to dodge or defend. If the dice value is 1d4 remove the bleed condition, otherwise reduce the dice value by one increment.
