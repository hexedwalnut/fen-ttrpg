You lunge towards your opponent to strike, roll an attack as normal, if your attack deals damage:

* **Plow**: You force a vigor/dodge contest. On a success you force a [grapple]({{< ref "/core/ref/grapple-condition.md" >}}).
* **Ox**: You deal additional [I]({{< ref "/core/ref/damage-types.md#internal-i" >}}) damage. This damage cannot be defended. You are [flat-footed]({{< ref "/core/ref/flat-footed-condition.md" >}})
* **Fool**: You force a dodge/notice contest. On a success your target gains the [dazed]({{< ref "/core/ref/dazed-condition.md" >}}) until the start of your next turn.
* **Boar**: You force a tactics/cognition contest. On a success you may move after dealing damage as per the [move]({{< ref "/core/ref/move-action.md" >}}) minor action.
