  You cannot gain the [Bite]({{< ref "/core/ref/bite-specialization.md" >}}) by any means if you take this specialization.

  You have a pair of snake-like fangs that can administer venom. Your fangs are considered a [short-blade]({{< ref "/core/ref/short-blade-archetype.md" >}}) weapon that deals 1d4 [P]({{< ref "/core/ref/damage-types.md#piercing" >}}) damage. If you successfully deal damage with your fangs, it deals an additional 3d6 [T]({{< ref "/core/ref/damage-types.md#toxic" >}}) damage to the target.
