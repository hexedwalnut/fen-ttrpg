+++

A weapon used with precision in short to long range engagements. The focus of these weapons is in precision and one needs to be trained for accuracy. We lump bows and rifles into one archetype because their archetypes are similar (i.e., precision based weapons with high skill ceilings). Note: not all ages have rifles. Note: This archetype include both short and long bows, rifles of all kinds, and other precision-focused ranged weapons.
