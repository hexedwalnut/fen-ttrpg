## Description

You have an incredible ability to see at long distances and notice things others miss. When you roll a contest to see something, roll one additional skill die. In addition, you can roll to see things at [long]({{< ref "/core/ref/long.md" >}}) range without the aid of a device (i.e., spyglass).
