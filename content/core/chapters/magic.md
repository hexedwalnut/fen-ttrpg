> Magicâ€¦ Who needs it?

Magic is an integral part of Fen during many of its ages. While the degree to which magic is powerful, common, and available changes, the essence of how magic works remains the same across time. Magic in its purest form is a source and a conduit. The conduit is often made of material, sometimes an actor, other times and object, that in someway can channel the power of magic given off by a source. A source is often ethereal or conceptual, a source of magical power where a conduit can pull from.

## The Magic Skill

The [magic skill]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}}) represents your ability to cast, understand, and control magical sources, spells, phenomena, and creatures.

When you take the [conduit]({{< ref "/core/ref/conduit-specialization.md" >}}) specialization you gain the [magic skill]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}}). Like stated above, this represents your ability to cast, understand, and control magical sources, spells, phenomena, and creatures. You initially have a magic skill of 1d6, it can be increased via the normal means (i.e., [talent specialization]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization" >}})).

## Magic Points (mp)

Works much like hit points, but instead of representing available effort to avoid death, it represents your total ability to cast or preform magic spells.

When you take the [conduit]({{< ref "/core/ref/conduit-specialization.md" >}}) specialization you gain the magic point statistic. This represents the total amount of magical ability you have at the current time. You spend mp to cast spells or to channel magical power. You regain mp by engaging with your source. When you take this specialization you gain a maximum mp of a non-explosive [magic]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}}) roll. This maximum can be increased via the [magic well specialization]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-well-specialization.md" >}}).

## Sources

A source is the place a conduit pulls their magic from. Once pulled from the source, the magic resides in what is often called a "magic well" inside the conduit. A source offers the conduit three categories of triggers: minor, major, and great. Minor source triggers offer one non-explosive magic skill roll of mp, major source triggers offer a magic skill roll of mp, great source triggers offer anywhere between a full refill of mp to temporarily increasing your maximum mp. Minor triggers take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, major triggers take anywhere from a several hours to a day, and great triggers can take anywhere from several days to whole lifetimes. Generally triggers need specific materials, locations, or situations to be conducted properly. Each source has their own triggers and are detailed in their own pages.

There are 5 sources in Fen:

### Pure Source 

*Also known as: World Tree, Celestine, or Enochian source.*

The pure source pulls from the core of the universe, the magical power given off by [Mores and Veeta]({{< ref "/wiki/mores-and-veeta.md" >}}). This source is volatile and powerful, held only briefly or by special groups of people throughout Fen's history (e.g., [Enochians]({{< ref "/wiki/enochians.md" >}}). This source allows a conduit to pull from any of the following sources as they see the connection between all creation. They have a unique connection to [Celestines]({{< ref "/wiki/celestine.md" >}}) as the Celestines are manifestations of the Pure Source. While powerful, this source is incredibly rare. To take this source you need GM approval. Conduits of this source act as if they have all the sources.

### [Divine Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/divine-source.md" >}})

*Also known as: Clerical, Liturgical, or Outer source.*

The divine source pulls from the magical power of a divine creature or entity. Divine creatures are defined broadly as any creature created via [Conic Convergence]({{< ref "/wiki/conic-convergence.md" >}}). For a full list of divine sources see [Divinities List]({{< ref "/wiki/divinities.md" >}}). To pull magic from this source, you need to engage with your chosen divinity. This action can consist of rituals such as masses, sacrifices, ritual combat, ceremonies, etc. Going to a divine place (i.e., hollowed ground devoted to your divinity, the holy land, the sight of a great battle or victory of your faith, etc.) offers a way to engage deeply with this source. Some minor forms of engagement might include prayer, creating idols or trinkets of your divinity, etc. A list of possible engagement with a divinity are included in each divinities' page in the wiki (Again see the [Divinities List]({{< ref "/wiki/divinities.md" >}}) for more details). 

### [Natural Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/natural-source.md" >}})

*Also known as: Primal, Druidic, or Elemental source.*

The natural source pulls from the magical power of Fen itself. Volcanoes, geysers,untouched groves, pure springs, sources of rivers, canyons, etc., all have magic energy embedded in them. A conduit that pulls from the natural source has learned to recognize, absorb, and unleash the natural sources of magic. To pull magic from this source, you need to engage with nature in some way. This might mean some sort of ritual hunting, meditation near a magical source, long isolated hikes, etc. Going to unique natural features (i.e., crystal caves, a large volcanoes or seismic activity, a strong storm or weather event, etc.) offers a way to engage deeply with this source. Some minor forms of engagement might include cultivating a natural garden, sleeping outside of town in nature, or keeping a pet. Note that the natural source is sapped by worked metal and industry. This might influence weapon or armor choices of a natural source conduit. 

### [Collective Source]({{< ref "/core/ref/collective-source.md" >}})

*Also known as: Arcane, Wizardly, or Knowledge source.*

The collective source pulls from the magical power innate in the deep study and collective knowledge of a group. While many conduits pull from something outside themself, a conduit that pulls from the collective source pulls from their own and their groups collective knowledge of magic. There is something in collective obsession and fascination that generates magical power. To pull magic from this source, a conduit needs to engage with this collective knowledge in some way. This might include study, spending time near a collection of artifacts and books detailing magic, attending lectures or classes by another magical conduit who pulls from this source, studying other sources by observing other conduits, etc. Going to places of great collective knowledge such as colleges, grand libraries, or long lost sources of knowledge (i.e., lost libraries, cities, or civilizations, etc.) offers a way to engage deeply with this source. Some minor forms of engagement might include study of a personal collection, small experimentation, or buying new books.

### Sacrificial Source

*Also known as: Dark, Destructive, or Harmful source.*

The sacrificial source pulls from the innate magical power of destruction and sacrifice. This source often becomes a conduit's source through desperation or a great need to enact some sort of task quickly. The sacrificial source is often a secondary or temporary source for the desperate conduit when they need magic for something and their other source is far away or dim. There is only one way to engage with the sacrificial source, it is to give something away, to sacrifice something of yourself. This need not be bodily (but often is), it could be memories, health, years of life span, etc. Sometimes the sacrificial source is engaged with via a divinity (such as the [Stranger]({{< ref "/wiki/stranger-divinity.md" >}}) other times it is just through self sacrificial acts, but regardless this source is highly dangerous and volatile but can offer great power at any location or time.

## Conduit

A conduit is an actor or object that can pull magic from a source. Some conduits are born or created from their beginning as a conduits, others experience some event, situation, or condition and become a conduit later. The conduit often times has a specific source that is their primary source, and can gain temporary or additional sources over time. Any player that can cast a spell is a conduit of some kind, actors become a conduit by selecting a specialization that allows them to cast magic and binds them with a source.
