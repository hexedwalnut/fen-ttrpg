The Alfim progenitor consists of all elf humanoids that live on Fen. Alfim are immigrants to Fen from Fae during the first age. The originally arrived as soldiers in the Alfinim Army battling with the forces of Eag. Alfim adapt to their natural environment. Alfinim are immortal beings, only capable of dying in battle, throughout the years of residing on Fen, Alfim have become more mortal, though their lives are still very long in comparison to other progenitors. There are five major groups of Alfim in Fen (though smaller groups of Alfim can exist adapted to their local environment):

- **Alfs - Mountain Elves**: They live on top of mountains throughout Fen, but mainly reside on one island, Alfjal. This island is the home to the original settlement of Alfinim, and has been continuously inhabited for the whole life of Fen. Alfs are tall and slender, have elongated heads and large alien eyes that are angled. They are often described as alien and faerie-like. As they are the closest Alfim to Alfinim, they are largely still immortal.
- **Akalf - Under Elves**: They live under ground, usually in large caverns inside mountains. Akalfs split from the Alfs over a dispute about the primary source of magic that should be used by Alf society. Alfs leaned towards the collective source, where Akalfs started to find the divine source as more powerful, pledging themselves to primordial gods. In addition, Akalfs preferred the lineage tracked through the mother, Alfs tracked through the father. This fight culminated in Akalfs moving underground. Akalfs look very much like Alfs, but usually have very pale skin and red eyes. They are still mostly immortal.
- **Shee - Wood Elves**: They split from the Alfs after the Akalfs in the Second Age. They saw the collective source as limiting, leaded towards the Natural source. As such they moved into the woods in the mainland near Alfjal, and now inhabit most woods and forests across Fen. The Shee are a bit more removed from the source of Alfinim immortality, as such, they live very long lives, but can die of old age. They look very much like Alfs but their eyes are less alien and their skin more bark-like.
- **Sjora - Sea Elves**: Split from the Shee when they began to become isolationists and refused to travel. The Sea elves take on the waves and sea, adapting with webbed hands and feet, some even can even breath underwater. They look like the Shee, but their skin has turned more blue and green and are much shorter. Their lives are even shorter than the Shee.
- **Kree - Snow Elves**: Split from the Sjora when they started to settle in the snowy planes and regions to the north of Fen. They are very much like the Sjora and Shee, having shorter lives and less tall statures. 

Outside of these groups, smaller groups of less organized elves might exists in different types of environments throughout Fen.

## Creating an Alfim

When you select this progenitor, you gain 10 *sp*. Alfim adapt to their environment, so based on where you plan to have you character from, has a great effect on what you may look like. It might help to select one of the five sections above, or stating an environment that your Alfim has adapted to. Either way write down a few descriptors for your character. Then select any number of progenitor specializations you think fit your character using the 10 *sp*.
