## Description

You can use your reaction to force a fight/vigor contest when rolling damage
with a [short-arm]({{< relref "/core/ref/short-arm-archetype.md" >}}) in
[adjacent]({{< relref "/core/ref/adjacent.md" >}}) range. If you win the contest,
you kick your target away from you. Until the start of your next turn, your
movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from the target.
