Resistance is a positive condition that applies a damage reduction to an actor. Resistance is written in the following format:

> Resistance (Resistance Number, Resistance Types)

The *Resistance Number* details how much damage the resistance reduces and the *Resistance Types* tells you which type(s) are affected by the damage resistance. 

For example, if an actor has **Resistance (10, F)** the actor has 10 damage resistance when dealt fire (F) damage. Likewise, if an actor has **Resistance (10, B, P, S)**, the actor has 10 damage resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. 

Unless otherwise stated, resistances are applied before all other forms of damage reduction (i.e., defense).
