## Description

Pick a weapon archetype. You gain an additional die when 
rolling damage using a weapon in the chosen archetype. The type of 
die is determined by the default sides of the weapon. For example, 
a standard [Dagger]({{< ref "/core/ref/dagger-weapon.md" >}}) has 
a weapon die of 1d4. When rolling damage after taking this 
specialization you instead roll 2d4. If, instead, the weapon had 
multiple default weapon dice you only add one additional die of 
the highest sides. If a weapon by default rolls 1d4+2d6+3d8 you 
gain an additional 1d8 after taking this specialization. This 
specialization applies to offhanded weapons as well.
