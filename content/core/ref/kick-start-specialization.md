## Description

You can use your reaction to force a 
[fight]({{< ref "/core/ref/fight-skill.md" >}})/[vigor]({{< ref "/core/ref/vigor-skill.md" >}})
contest when rolling damage with a [short-arm]({{< ref "/core/ref/short-arm-archetype.md" >}})
in [adjacent]({{< ref "/core/ref/adjacent.md" >}}) range. If you win the contest,
you kick your target away from you. Until the start of your next turn, your 
movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from the target.
