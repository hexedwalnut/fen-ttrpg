## Description

You have an intense interest in dinosaurs as spurred on by your ancestors' domestication and use of dinosaurs in their everyday lives. You gain the [nature]({{< ref "/core/ref/nature-skill.md" >}}) skill and can roll an additional skill die to tame, interact, or recall knowledge about dinosaurs.

In addition, you may roll an additional weapon die on all weapons made of dinosaur bones or fossils and can treat the damage as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances.
