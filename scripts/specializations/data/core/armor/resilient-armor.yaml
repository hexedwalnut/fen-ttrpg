  Pick an armor archetype X. You have learned how to best wear this armor when its 
  close to break. When an armor is deal enough damage to its defense to be 
  sundered, you may use your reaction to cause a Vigor/Fight contest between you 
  and the damage dealer. If you win the contest, the armor is not sundered, 
  instead keeping 1 defense. This reaction cannot be applied to magical effects 
  that cause damage to armor.

  Taking this specialization more than once for the same archetype has no extra 
  effect. The cost of this specialization does not increase when you buy it 
  another time.
