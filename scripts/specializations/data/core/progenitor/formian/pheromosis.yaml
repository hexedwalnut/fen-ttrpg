  You gain the ability to communicate telepathically with any willing actor within sight of you. This communication does not take any more effort than speaking regularly. Additionally, you can communicate with any Formian with this specialization within 1,000 feet of you without line of sight. 

  You can communicate with Formians with this specialization even further, using a Major action while in combat, as long as there is a connection between you and them via multiple Formians all within 1,000 feet of each other. This form of communication takes more visible effort and can be easily identified while you are communicating this way. Every Formian in the line will understand your message and thus can be used to transmit a single message to many Formians at once.
