# Welcome to the Fen Wiki

This is the Fen Wiki, a place for lore and info about the world! This page includes known historical knowledge accessible to anyone who has studied history or access to historical accounts, geographic information (including maps) to those who have access to libraries with maps, and magical knowledge to those who have studied magic or religion, or who have access to arcane or clerical resources. You may feel free to read through this source of knowledge at anytime as it is accessible, but make sure your character would have access to this knowledge before you act on it. I will treat this place as a growing body of text as the history of fen continues to evolve.

**Disclaimer**: While I expect that this body of text will be pretty canonical it represents the knowledge of Fen that is known by the current age or past ages of Fen. As such, it could be wrong, the GM still has final say about the correctness of information included in the Fen Wiki. *Remember the GM can always lie.*
