Articulate represents the actor's ability to navigate social or interpersonal relationships. This includes an actor's ability to deceive, persuade, explain, or otherwise articulate a coherent point verbally or through social interaction. Articulate represents the summation of an actor's social skills. Articulate could also represent how an actor is perceived. For example, a faction or region with a high articulate might be perceived better than a faction or region with a low articulate.
