The Avian progenitor consists of bird humanoids of all kinds. Avians are divinely created by the Celestial Emperor to battle the rising tides spurred on by Notos (the Leviathan, father of all sea monsters). Avians span a wide gamut of bird humanoids and are considered among the most diverse in terms of looks and builds of any progenitor in Fen. As such, when creating a Avian, they can look pretty much like any bird that you would like. There are three general groupings of Avians: 

* Tiercel: they generally boast strong beaks and talons and tend to look more like a bird of prey than other birds
* Passerine: a loose class of non-Tiercel birds that are generally very diverse in look and ability
* Owli: the closest to the grace of the Celestial Emperor. Owli's look like owls and generally have some magical ability. They occupy the smallest group in Avian society, generally sequestered to the dynastic family in the Owli Dynasty.

## Creating an Avian

*Note, you cannot create an Owli unless given permission by your GM.*

When you select this progenitor, you gain 10 *sp*. Avians span a wide range of looks, heights, and builds. Write a few words on your character sheet to describe your character, if you want, you can specify a type of bird that your character most resembles. It can also be helpful to list whether people would consider you a Tiercel or Passerine by looking at you. Then select any number of progenitor specializations you think fit your character using the 10 *sp*.
