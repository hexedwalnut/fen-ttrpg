  You call a lightning bolt down on one target actor that might leap to another.

  You deal 1d6 [Area of Effect]({{< ref "/core/ref/damage.md#area-of-effect" >}}) [L]({{< ref "/core/ref/damage-types.md#lightning" >}}) damage to one target you can see within [long]({{< ref "/core/ref/long.md" >}}) range. That target can make a [dodge]({{< ref "/core/ref/dodge-skill.md" >}}) contest against your [magic]({{< ref "/core/ref/magic-skill.md" >}}), on a success the target takes half as much damage. If the target fails, you can select a different actor and repeat the above process.

  ### Sink

  For every 2 *mp* you spend to cast this spell over the original, increase the damage by 1d6.
