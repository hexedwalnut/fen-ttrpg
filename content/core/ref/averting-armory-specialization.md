## Description

Pick an archetype X. All weapons in chosen archetype gains 
[Defensive(1)]({{< ref "core/ref/defensive-trait.md" >}}) for
you. If you are taking this specialization again after the first
time and select the same weapon archetype, you instead increase 
the number of Defensive by one for that archetype. For 
example, if you have taken this specialization two times before 
for short-arms taking it again, you move from Defensive(2) 
to Defensive(3).
