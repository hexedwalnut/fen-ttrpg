Vulnerability is a negative condition that applies a damage increase to an actor. Vulnerability is written in the following format:

> Vulnerability (Vulnerability Number, Vulnerability Types)

The *Vulnerability Number* details how much damage the vulnerability increases and the *Vulnerability Types* tells you which type(s) are affected by the damage increase.

For example, if an actor has **Vulnerability (10, F)**, when the actor takes any amount of fire (F) damage they take an additional 10 points of damage. Likewise if an actor has **Vulnerability (5, B, P, S)**, the actor takes an additional 5 points of damage every time it takes either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.

If an actor has two vulnerabilities to the same damage type, only apply the vulnerability with the highest number.

Unless otherwise stated, vulnerabilities are applied before all damage reductions or damage increases.
