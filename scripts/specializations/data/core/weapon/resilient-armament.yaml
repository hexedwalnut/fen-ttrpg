  Pick a weapon archetype X. You have learned how to best wield a weapon when it is close
  to break. When a weapon is deal enough damage to its defense to be sundered,
  you may use your reaction to cause a Vigor/Fight contest between you and the
  damage dealer. If you win the contest, the weapon is not sundered, instead
  keeping 1 defense. This reaction cannot be applied to magical effects that
  cause damage to armaments.

  Taking this specialization more than once for the same archetype has no extra effect. The cost of this specialization does not increase when you buy it another time.
