  *You cannot take this specialization without GM approval*

  You are the Kra for this age, a hero of Alfims.

  You gain a new tally statistic called "Kra". It has a total of 20 tallies. When you act to save, help, or further the ends of your community you gain a tally. You gain abilities based on your current number of tallies.

  Regardless you immediately gain the effects of the following specializations:

  - [Long Life]({{< ref "/core/ref/long-life-specialization.md" >}})
  - [Dark-vision]({{< ref "/core/ref/dark-vision-specialization.md" >}})
  - [Aus-child]({{< ref "/core/ref/aus-child-specialization.md" >}})
  
  You also gain your choice of one of the following:

  - [Immortal]({{< ref "/core/ref/immortal-specialization.md" >}})
  - [Fleet-foot]({{< ref "/core/ref/fleet-foot-specialization.md" >}})
  - [Natural Camouflage]({{< ref "/core/ref/natural-camouflage-specialization.md" >}})

  You gain abilities based on the current tally as per the following table:

  | Tally | Effect |
  | ----- | ------ |
  | 3     | [Talent]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization.md" >}}) |
  | 5     | [Talent]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization.md" >}}) |
  | 7     | You gain an additional die on contests while talking to Alfim |
  | 9     | You can cast Dream and Calm Emotions once per day |
  | 12    | [Talent]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization.md" >}}) |
  | 15    | [Talent]({{< ref "/core/ref/talent-specialization.md" >}}) |

  Once you reach 20 tallies in Kra, you lose control of your character as the Kra takes over. Your GM will work without to lay out what the transition to Kra looks like for your character.
