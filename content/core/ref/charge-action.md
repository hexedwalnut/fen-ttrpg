*1 major action*

You move and attack in one action. You may not charge while engaged with an enemy in adjacent range. You can take the [move]({{< ref "/core/ref/move-action.md" >}}) minor action twice then the [attack]({{< ref "/core/ref/attack-action.md" >}}) major action once. The attack must be performed against a target within adjacent range. Note that if there is no target within range, the attack is lost.
